## Hello world!

My name is Daniel Walley. I am a web developer specializing in front-end development.

I have six years experience developing on content management systems. For the past two years I have been learning React.js, Node.js, Bootstrap, and SQL.

Outside of developing, I am a professional musician and military veteran. I also enjoy PC gaming, golfing, and personal fitness.
